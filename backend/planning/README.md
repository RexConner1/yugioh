## Deere Project 4

This app is meant to simulate the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game, a card-based battle game that is basically just glorified math. It is a simplified version, with normal, non-effect monsters and minimal spell/trap cards to make project completion possible. More of the game's logic (ex. effect monsters) will be added as a gold plan.
